Tripod, a table lamp built from powder-coated steel with brass details, reflects the clean minimalism of historic Copenhagen-based duo Hvidt & Mølgaard. Considered Old Masters of mid-century Danish design, their pieces often lend a sculptural element to the spaces they inhabit. This scaled-down table lamp version is available in three colours: Black, Maroon, and Moss."

With Lato, Nichetto wanted to keep the simplicity and streamline into a timeless side table in a style that could easily be the centre of attention."
