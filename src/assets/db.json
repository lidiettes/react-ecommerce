      "description": "After the success of its floor lamp, &Tradition has expanded the Tripod series to include a table lamp with the same timeless design. Tripod, a table lamp built from powder-coated steel with brass details, reflects the clean minimalism of historic Copenhagen-based duo Hvidt & Mølgaard. Considered Old Masters of mid-century Danish design, their pieces often lend a sculptural element to the spaces they inhabit. This scaled-down table lamp version is available in three colours: Black, Maroon, and Moss."

      "description": "At first glance, Lato resembles a sculpture, with its slim, oval or round table top balanced by an oval-shaped base. Striking, graphic and poetic, its purity of form is proof that simple is sophisticated. With Lato, Nichetto wanted to keep the simplicity and streamline into a timeless side table in a style that could easily be the centre of attention."
