        description: 'After the success of its floor lamp, &Tradition has expanded the Tripod series to include a table lamp with the same timeless design. Tripod, a table lamp built from powder-coated steel with brass details, reflects the clean minimalism of historic Copenhagen-based duo Hvidt & MÃ¸lgaard. Considered Old Masters of mid-century Danish design, their pieces often lend a sculptural element to the spaces they inhabit. This scaled-down table lamp version is available in three colours: Black, Maroon, and Moss.'
